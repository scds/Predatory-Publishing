Please note that at 40:57, Neera says "predatory publishing" when she is actually referring to "predatory conferences."

Our co-presenters, Neera Bhatnagar and Olga Perkovic, mention the following resources in their talk:

- McMaster LibGuide on [“How to How To Avoid Predatory Publishers and Conferences”](https://libguides.mcmaster.ca/predatorypublishing)

- PDF of ["Identifying Deceptive Publishers: A Checklist"](https://libguides.mcmaster.ca/ld.php?content_id=36114576)

- [Think Check Submit](https://thinkchecksubmit.org/) (a resource to help you identify predatory journals and publishers)

- [Think Check Attend](https://thinkcheckattend.org/) (a resource to help you identify predatory conferences)

- The [DOAJ](https://doaj.org/) (Directory of Open Access Journals)
